\title{Dot density scale and compute dot data
Performs random rounding when scaling, randomly distributes dots in geographic areas and
randomizes the order.}
\usage{
compute_dots(geo_data, categories, scale = 1, datum = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{geo_data}{The base geographic data (sp or sf format)}

\item{categories}{Vector of column names to re-aggreagte}

\item{scale}{How many units should be represented by 1 dot}

\item{datum}{allow the selection of dataum in which we sample dots in polygon}
